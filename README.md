## Training Piano App

Simple Piano App that I developed to help me learning piano. Try to hit maximum notes in 30 seconds. The greater the difficulty, the higher the score. You can connect your MIDI device if your browser supports [MIDIAccess API](https://caniuse.com/#feat=mdn-api_midiaccess).

Built with react.
